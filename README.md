### The Proposed system is implemented as a web software created by using python at the backend and html & CSS the front end , the  system which will flaunt a simple and elegant User Interface and also be time efficient. In order to make it less time consuming we are aiming at a more specific questionnaire which will be followed by the system, the web application consists separate pages for of fetal health and breast cancer predictions the end user can select the page at the landing page of the application, when an end-user goes to the prediction page it asks the users details of data to predict the diseases. The application works as web-based software and can be accessed anywhere anytime using a computer and internet
### This Application can predict the fetal abnormalities and 3 type of breast cancers

        INAVASIVE BREAST CANCER üéÄ
            ‚Ä¢	intraductal carcinoma or stage 0 breast cancer
            ‚Ä¢	invasive ductal carcinoma
            ‚Ä¢	invasive lobular carcinoma

        FETAL HEALTH üë©üèΩ‚Äçüçº
            ‚Ä¢	Normal
            ‚Ä¢	Pathological
            ‚Ä¢	Suspect
